Hi there!

If you're looking at this file, that means you're probably using RPG Maker MV.
I have enlarged this tileset to 48x48 just for you!
You should be able to use the main file just fine, but there are some drawbacks:

It's not setup to work with MV's autotile system, so you need to place each tile by hand.

The waterfall and water sparkle animations are also not setup under MV's rules.
I think you can set them up as doodads, so give that a look:

I've also heard you can set them up as events, or monsters.
Though I think you'll need the 8-frame waterfall and 4-frame sparkles from my seasonal forest packs to make that work:

I don't personally use MV, so I'm just going off second-hand information from people who do.

Ultimately, I recommend different methods:

Use Tiled and bypass MV's map editor:

Switch to 16x16 tiles so you can use this and my other assets without resizing:

At any rate, you're welcome to join the Mana Seed Discord server and talk with other MV users to discuss your options.
