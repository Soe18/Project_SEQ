"gentle waterfall A" has multiple rows of 6-frame looping animations. It is a 3-part waterfall system.

Part 1: the top tile
	Use the animation in row 1 or 2 to animate the very top/first tile of your waterfall.
	Row 1 is for a diagonal edge. Mirror it as necessary.

Part 2: the falling water
	Place row 3 below the top tile, then row 4 below that.
	Rows 3 and 4 are meant to stay together at all times.
	The bottom of row 4 blends seamlessly into the top of row 3.
	Repeat these (3,4,3,4,3,4,3, etc) for the length of your waterfall.
	The last tile in the column of falling water can be either 3 or 4.

Part 3: the splashing bottom
	The remaining tiles are for your animated foamy splash at the bottom of the waterfall.
	There are 3 sets of foamy splash, rows 5 and 6, rows 7 and 8, and rows 9 and 10. Always use them together like that.
	
	Place the front-facing splash (rows 7 and 8) on top of the bottom waterfall tile.
	Row 7 should cover the last waterfall tile (it's going to be either row 3 or 4), so the flat bottom doesn't show.
	
	Rows 9 and 10 are your diagonal splash tile. Use them on columns where the top is the diagonal (row 1).	
	Then under the row 10 tile, place the tile on row 6. It's technicaly a 3 tile-high animation.
	Mirror these tiles as necessary, just like the top tile.
	
	The half-splash in rows 5 and 6 is for your end-caps.
	It goes on the left or right (flip it) of your front-facing splash tile.

-----------------------------------------

"gentle water sparkles A" has three 3-frame looping animations, though you can flip and mirror them to make a sort of autotile.
(don't rotate, the lines need to move horizontally)

Row 1 has a full tile of sparkles.
Row 2 has a diagonal half-tile of sparkles. Use these for inside corners.
Row 3 has a small 1/4 tile of sparkles. Use these for outside corners.

Advice:
Don't cover the water with sparkles, or use easily identifiable patterns.
Sprinkle them around the edges of the water.
If you can turn them on and off at random, that might also look good.

If you need 4-frame sparkle animations, you can find "water sparkles B" in my seasonal forest packs:

Lastly, there's a sample waterfall setup in bright red on the gentle forest tile sheet.
This is here to show you how to setup the cliff wall tiles around it.
The red waterfall is just there as a demo.

Between this guide and my example maps, you should be able to figure out how to use my waterfalls.
